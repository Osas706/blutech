# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Steps:
** install react on my folder (blutect folder),
** converted my figma design to jsx ,
** created a json file for dummy product details,
** mapped through my product details to display dummy details,
** created my apiContext to create my functions and manage my state
** install axios for fetching data after using the search bar
** pushed finished codes to repo
